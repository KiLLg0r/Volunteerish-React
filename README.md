# ➤ Volunteerish

Volunteerish is an open-source application created by students and intended for all people who want to help or be helped. The application aims to unite all social categories and eliminate discrimination between them. The user interface is a simple one with easy-to-use menus, specially created so that it can be easily used by everyone. Users can also ask for help, as well as help in turn. Volunteerish has 5 main menus: Home, Announcements, Shop, Messages and Settings.

When you press the button, a menu will open where it will be completed, as the case may be, with the description of the announcement, its difficulty and the category to which it belongs. Details such as country, state, and city are automatically entered from the data provided by the user upon registration and are subject to change.

In the Shop section there is a mini shop with personalized products with our logo and slogan or with other accessories or clothing items. These can be bought with the points obtained when the user helps a person.

The points are calculated according to the category to which the announcements belongs, its difficulty and the distance from the user.
